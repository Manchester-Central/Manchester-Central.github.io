			Robotics is a field that requires math. Like a lot of it. It's one step below scientific
			simulations and computer graphics. It relies on a wide range of topics, but usually has
			a viable solution using only fundamentals. Lets go over many of the topics that come up
			in robotics, embedded systems, and primitive AI. Keep an eye out for bolded lines, they 
			are questions you should be able to answer at that point.

			The rest of this article assumes the reader has a basic understanding of algebra, and
			how to solve equations. If you are a freshmen, don't panic! Everything covered should
			be within your grasp after your first year or two of high school.
