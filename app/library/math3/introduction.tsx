            From this point on, all material is higher education. Do not worry if it's to peculiar, puzzling,
			perplexing, or perspiring. This is a resource for harder challenges, to add depth for difficult
			topics in robotics. Tackling the mathematics of AI and Machine Learning, Calculus, Optical Systems,
			Statistics, and so so much more.
        </p>

			These topics are lightly covered for the curious and idle minds. The folks who are hungry for more,
			and are looking for a challenge. You have been warned. ðŸ’€
